fortunes
========

This is a collection of fortunes I've put together myself. The `./homestuck`
directory contains quotes from the Homestuck webcomic by Andrew Hussie on
(MS Paint Adventures)[http://mspaintadventures.com/].

Install
-------

To install fortunes, follow these instructions.

1. Identify the ones you want and run `make [target]` to build the strfiles; for example, `make` by itself or `make all` builds all of the fortunes. Use `make all-homestuck` to build all of the fortunes under `./homestuck` or `make homestuck/davestrider` to build only that fortune file.
2. Repeat until all of your desired targets have been built.
3. Optionally, run `make clean` to start over.
4. Run `make install` as root and everything will be installed on your system.
