TT: I understand you have recently come into possession of the beta release of "The Game of the Year", as featured in respectable periodicals such as GameBro Magazine.
%
TT: I can't control myself.
TT: I must have a weakness for insufferable pricks.
%
TT: John.
%
TT: You're wearing one of your disguises now, aren't you?
TT: You are typing to me right now while wearing something ridiculous.
%
TT: Ok.
TT: Why don't you go get the game from your father?
%
TT: I know, John.
%
TT: It looks like you managed to retrieve the beta. Excellent.
TT: I'm going to try to connect.
%
TT: The rabbit?
%
TT: I've heard tales of this wretched creature often. Its Homeric legend is practically ensconced in the fold of my personal mythology by now.
%
TT: Why don't we focus on the matter at hand?
%
TT: You are running the client application. I am running the server, so I am the host user. I have established a connection with you. This is sufficient for us to play the game.
%
TT: Why don't we get started?
%
TT: Sorry. I'm just getting a feel for the controls.
%
TT: I will try to be more careful next time.
%
TT: I'll give it a shot.
%
TT: No luck.
TT: It appears to be out of range. I'm guessing it is too far away from you, the "player".
%
TT: It seems expanding the dimensions of your room cost us some "Build Grist".
TT: But deploying the lathe did not appear to incur any expense.
TT: It looks like certain objects are freebies, probably to help you set up the game.
%
TT: I think it's up to you to find out.
TT: All I can do is drop stuff in your house, and move it around, apparently.
%
TT: I don't think you can as the client. You will need to install the server application.
TT: You should have received both in separate envelopes. I am running both on my computer right now.
%
TT: Did you get another envelope in the mail?
%
TT: Once you install the server and establish a connection, I'm sure you will be able to manipulate my environment in the same manner.
TT: Are you sure you didn't get it?
%
TT: Now that your room is bigger, why don't you move to the far corner?
TT: It will extend the range of the cursor, and I can reach the items.
TT: Which... you threw out the window for some reason?
%
TT: What have you been doing in here all afternoon, anyway?
%
TT: I like to use trees.
%
TT: It's not exceptionally practical.
TT: But I think they are elegant.
%
TT: Yes. Two more large gizmos.
%
TT: If I had to guess, they appear to facilitate a sort of system involving punch card-based alchemy.
%
TT: That remains to be seen.
TT: Maybe you should go investigate?
%
TT: The one you threw into the yard?
%
TT: What were you doing with it in the first place?
TT: I am not sensing a lot of regard for the personal property of others.
TT: Is this how your pent-up frustration with your father manifests itself?
%
TT: Your bathroom is a mess.
TT: Did you do that too?
%
TT: There's a cake in the toilet.
%
TT: I'm tempted to clean it up for you.
%
TT: My Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder complex?
TT: Can a disorder also be a complex?
%
TT: Sounds complicated.
%
TT: Whoops.
%
TT: No, I have it under control.
TT: You can keep playing with your telescope.
%
TT: I think I can patch it up.
TT: Just give me a little space.
TT: Why don't you go have a look at the Cruxtruder?
%
TT: The thing I put in your living room.
%
TT: There's a door there?
%
TT: I didn't see it.
TT: I just thought it fit nicely into that groove.
%
TT: Oh fuck.
%
TT: Sorry. I keep losing the wireless signal.
TT: Must be the weather.
TT: I would look for a stronger signal in another part of the house, but I'd rather not risk an encounter with my mother.
TT: I battled through her cloud of gin and derision once already this evening.
%
TT: Yes. Cake, jesters, unfaltering love and support.
TT: Quite a road to hoe there.
TT: Though I suppose I'm complicit for not informing Social Services about your situation.
%
TT: That presents the same problem.
TT: Also, it's raining, remember?
TT: And dark.
%
TT: Yes, the sun has already had its way with us here on the east coast.
TT: Its lurid glare has moved on to younger timezones.
%
TT: Need some help?
%
TT: I've been looking at the GameFAQ walkthroughs to figure some of this stuff out.
TT: Hold while I read further.
%
TT: All of these walkthroughs are extremely short.
TT: None progress much further than this point.
%
TT: True.
TT: Now that the lid is off, you will need to extrude some "Cruxite".
%
TT: I feel like we should be hurrying. That countdown is making me nervous.
TT: John?
TT: Oh. Your PDA is trapped under the cruxite now, isn't it.
TT: Anyway, it looks like you are going to need this card too.
%
TT: That is probably the "Kernelsprite".
TT: It apparently needs to be "prototyped".
TT: Twice, actually.
TT: Whatever the hell that means.
TT: These walkthroughs are horrendously written.
%
TT: That was only "Tier One Prototyping".
TT: There is still another tier to the prototyping process.
TT: Which for all we know merely advances this entity through increasingly esoteric states of linguistics.
%
TT: This unmitigated poppycock?
%
TT: The alchemiter?
%
TT: Try to learn the lingo.
%
TT: Your dad is getting home.
TT: John?
TT: What did you do with your PDA this time?
TT: I'm working on the bathroom.
TT: But we are running low on Build Grist.
%
TT: I see.
TT: Do you suppose it has anything to do with the game?
%
TT: I think it's very likely.
TT: The walkthroughs vaguely suggest an impending threat before they end.
TT: The already poorly constructed sentences become even more curt and ambiguous.
TT: As if written hastily and with a sense of alarm.
TT: Actually, their dedication to updating the walkthrough under such circumstances is admirable.
%
TT: If the meteor is a game construct, I think the only thing to do is to proceed, and try to solve the dilemma on the game's terms.
TT: Try using the lathe.
TT: It says you can use the card on it, but isn't more specific than that.
%
TT: Really, it is a labor to read this drivel.
TT: If I read any more my brain will need to be spoon-fed from a jar.
TT: While it blows spit bubbles in a highchair.
TT: I think I will write my own walkthrough.
TT: That is, after we make sure you don't die.
%
TT: I'm back.
%
TT: Patience. You still haven't used the new totem.
%
TT: I believe it will create the item on the punch card.
%
TT: We'll see.
TT: I've found no evidence that anyone has successfully created the item.
TT: And the content of the card appears to be variable from session to session.
TT: In one instance it was described as an "eggy loking thign" [sic].
%
TT: According to the Atheneum, it is a free item.
TT: This speaks to its importance, in my view.
TT: Now off you go.
%
TT: John?
TT: Are you there?
%
TT: I know.
TT: I've been watching you scramble through the house like a lunatic.
TT: You should have answered me sooner.
%
TT: No. I'm sure he'll turn up.
TT: We have more important things to address right now.
%
TT: I don't know that either. But I've determined your neighborhood was destroyed by the meteor. Wherever you were transported, it saved you from the impact.
TT: I've been reading reports in the news. Over the last few days, there have been many smaller meteor collisions with people's homes around the world.
TT: And they seem to be getting bigger. Yours was the biggest they've identified so far.
%
TT: Perhaps.
%
TT: Yes, but wait.
TT: We should retrieve your PDA. Yet again.
TT: It will help to keep tabs on each other while you investigate.
TT: I think I can get you closer to it, if I can replenish our grist supply somewhat.
TT: There may be a way to recycle some that we already used.
%
TT: I'll meet you out on the balcony.
%
TT: What?
%
TT: I was working on something to send you, but I was running late with it.
TT: I didn't want you to think I believed meager well wishes alone would suffice for the occasion.
TT: That said, happy birthday, John.
%
TT: John, are you ok?
TT: You seem a bit tentative.
%
TT: Perhaps the early symptoms of an anxiety disorder, like post-traumatic stress?
%
TT: Well, if you can pull yourself together, there are a few more things we should try.
TT: Like prototyping the Kernelsprite again, if possible.
TT: We should hurry. My laptop battery won't last forever.
%
TT: We have to hurry along. I'm running low on battery power.
%
TT: I doubt it matters.
TT: We might as well just use any old crap lying around.
%
TT: See if you can distract it.
TT: I'll try to sneak up on it.
%
TT: I can't find it anywhere in the house.
TT: No time to worry about it.
TT: The next thing we should do is get your server copy of the game from the car.
TT: You need to connect to my client, so I can repeat your steps and presumably join you, wherever you are.
TT: We should do this quickly, before my house burns down.
%
TT: There will be soon.
%
TT: It looks like it requires a lot of grist to move.
TT: I don't have enough to relocate the door, either.
%
TT: Zero.
%
TT: I have a better idea.
TT: Meet me upstairs.
%
TT: I'm lifting the car up to the balcony.
%
TT: Once it is up, retrieve the game. Then I'll put it back down on the driveway.
%
TT: Then break a window.
%
TT: It's just a window, and this is sort of an emergency.
TT: Otherwise I promise I'll handle the car with velvet gloves.
%
TT: In some cultures the persistent refusal of a lady's invitation to play a game with her would be a sign of wanton disrespect.
TT: Either that, or flagrant homosexuality.
%
TT: I know.
TT: Sometimes I wonder how you are ever allowed to pay for meals in restaurants.
TT: It must be hard to keep a low profile when you're always overhearing awed voices whisper, "It's that guy who has a blog." 
%
TT: Navigating the urban landscape I'm sure is difficult enough without an obstacle course of deferential flesh and skyward asses.
TT: Perhaps adapting the art of parkour to your unique environment would help?
%
TT: Heavy is the crown. 
%
TT: Breathtaking magnanimity! 
%
TT: Indeed, nary a jewel tumbles from your wishbox of daily exploits which I imagine does not sparkle. 
%
TT: Baseless accusation!
%
TT: I know this very well.
TT: I cannot hasten his mail's delivery, however.
%
TT: More than you know.
TT: It perfectly mollifies my grief over the demise of chivalry.
