%
TG: but
TG: the seal on the bottle is unbroken
TG: are you suggesting someone put piss in my apple juice at the factory
%
TG: why did the fat kid or whoever drank it know what piss tasted like
TG: i mean his reaction was nigh instantaneous
%
TG: ok i can accept that
TG: monster B-list celebrity douchebags are cunning and persistent pranksters
TG: also fred savage has a really punchable face

TG: how do you retrieve artifacts from it
%
TG: stack?? hahahahahaha

TG: hash map
TG: my bro taught me a few tricks he basically knows everything and is awesome
%
TG: you should probably brush up on your data structures
%
TG: did you at least allocate your strife specibus
%
TG: it could free up a card for you
TG: plus let you attack stuff whenever things get too hot to handle
TG: which is never
TG: what have you got
%
TG: wow you really suck at this dont you
TG: just get rid of the arms and then allocate the hammer to the specibus
%
TG: i dont know just use the arms on any old thing and see if it works
%
TG: hammerkind?
%
TG: ok that will be the permanent allocation for your specibus
TG: i guess i should have mentioned that
%
TG: hope you like hammers dude!
%
TG: hey GG is looking for you why are you even so popular all of a sudden
TG: is today some sort of special occasion or something

%
TG: i heard you got the box
TG: i hope you appreciate my heroic fatherly perseverance in getting it to you

TG: also i hope you appreciate how many no-talent douches had their mitts on that bunny before you
TG: its like a grubby baton in some huge douchebag marathon
TG: hey where are you

TG: and for that matter you should probably wash your hands of flighty broads and their snarky horseshit altogether
%
TG: oh man
TG: how big is it
%
TG: like the size of texas
TG: or just rhode island
TG: theyre always throwing around these geographical comparisons to give us a sense of scale like it really means anything to us

TG: dont watch me ok
%
TG: like i know you dream about me enough already
TG: lets keep some shit left to the imagination ok
%
TG: the last thing i need is for your weird brain webcam to be snapping shots of my dong
TG: your grandpa was a sick fuck why would he build a voyeurbot for a little girl
TG: fuck
%
TG: what
%
TG: what is it
%
TG: what bird
%
TG: i wouldnt know anything about that
%
TG: that could be anyones sword
%
TG: what does it look like

TG: forged by stoic asian masters
TG: hells of rude kinds of expensive
%
TG: wait
TG: what do you mean
TG: dammit hold on a minute
%
TG: wow awesome
TG: so now i guess instead having of a wise or helpful spirit guide sprite thing
TG: im stuck with this brainless feathery asshole
%
TG: we need to wake you up
TG: youre not very logical like this
TG: kind of dumb really
%
TG: yeah but come on you sleep like 20 hours a day
%
TG: where are you sitting

%
TG: well where are they
TG: you say there will be stairs
TG: and yet
TG: i see no stairs
%
TG: sorry
%
TG: am i supposed to break that thing
TG: or hatch it
TG: or what
%
TG: also what happened to all my shit
TG: the stuff scattered all over the roof
TG: did you put it somewhere
%
TG: i mean not that i care
TG: it was a lot of mostly useless garbage
%
TG: i was going to use it to fight my bro with
TG: but i guess i forgot in the heat of battle
TG: also he was too fast
%
TG: ok so
TG: the egg is now in a nest made of shitty swords and soft puppet ass
TG: please advise
%
TG: do you think thatll take more than four hours
%
TG: its hot as the sizzle side of the steak
%
TG: maybe i should try to get it back
TG: and put it in the microwave
%
TG: you mean the jumper block thing
%
TG: wait what
TG: the thing costs 1000 for me
%
TG: what
TG: man i only got 200 to splash around with in roses rainbow world
TG: what the hell
%
TG: hang on ill ask
%
TG: she says 20
%
TG: yeah
TG: so i guess you can buy everything now
%
TG: ok now i know youre making this shit up
%
TG: well all i got here is the designix which i cant deploy cause i dont have any purples
TG: and the expensive as hell jumper thing and the cheap shunts which i assume do dick all without the jumpers to put em on
TG: oh also this cd which is 100 but i didnt drop cause it seemed like a stiff allocation of resources for now
%
TG: so with each new connection in our player chain i guess new weird deployables are introduced
%
TG: hey look we're learning stuff
%
TG: what should i do with these beta copies
TG: i dont really need them anymore
%
TG: wow that was a weird answer
TG: but ok
%
TG: ok
%
TG: so i guess this is just a built in designix
TG: which is sort of cool i guess
TG: since i wont have to go downstairs and bang the hallway door into the thing and squeeze through every time i want to punch a card
TG: because of course you couldnt have just put it next to the alchemiter in the first place
TG: but then i have to go downstairs anyway to make totems and get cruxite and stuff
TG: so really who cares
%
TG: im building up your house
TG: by the way why do you live in this weird compound
TG: do you host east european industrial raves
TG: nevermind the point is
TG: im out of grist
TG: so if youre done whipping that ogre like a rented mule
TG: maybe you could convert it into a grist windfall
%
TG: i dont know beach the thing first i guess
TG: unless you were planning on sailing that ogre down the mississippi with a runaway slave
%
TG: what do you mean
TG: you kill it
TG: release a shitload of grist
TG: maybe take one of your needles and puncture the base of its skull
TG: does it even have a skull
TG: or a brain stem
TG: can you find out
%
TG: what
TG: but you just rigged the thing with an oedipal harness and rode its torso like a log flume ride down a magical rainbow
%
TG: this is bullshit its an unfeeling monster who gives a fuck
%
TG: wow fuck ok
TG: you can either kill it for the loot or wait a couple hours for gristtorrent to steal more of johns
TG: but then again ill be pretty busy in a couple hours so make up your mind
%
TG: no but hes still got a ton so screw him
%
TG: yeah me too
%
TG: who
%
TG: oh yeah sure
TG: i command her alright i am like the pimpmaster hustledaddy of all snippy bookshrews
%
TG: wrong what do you want
%
TG: what the hell
%
TG: you have no idea dude she is so in my grill
TG: like a stray hotdog that rolled down there
TG: and now its too much trouble to fish out with the tongs
TG: so you just watch it like crack and turn black
%
TG: man wait
TG: whats this about
TG: you have a thing for her dont you
TG: dont deny it bro its obvious
%
TG: hahahaha so terrible
TG: what a transparent dodge
TG: all hiding behind your alien shit
TG: just admit it
TG: you want me to help you win her over
%
TG: ok well its easy
TG: for everything she says take her to mean just the opposite
TG: see not everybody always means literally what they say the way john and jade always do
%
TG: oh my flipping christ
TG: ok if you want rose to dig you you got to leave that crap in the shitty scifi novels where it belongs
%
TG: oh ok
TG: that was pretty good
TG: maybe even too deadpan but its a start keep at it
%
TG: hahaha yes youre on a roll
%
TG: oh
TG: alright look
TG: if you want to keep her attention you got to pull out all the stops
TG: reverse psychology mind games all sorts of machiavellian bullshit
TG: i mean unless youre really smooth and inherently likeable like me which youre not
%
TG: thats kind of the obtuse alien way of getting it but yeah
TG: be like
TG: an antagonism ninja
TG: like her
TG: i dont know you sort of remind me of her anyway so maybe thats a good thing
TG: it could be a horrible thing though
%
TG: yeah i guess i am
TG: i guess im saying be a less shitty troll
%
TG: good luck bro
%
TG: dont care
%
TG: ok im in
%
TG: the medium
%
TG: what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn hours
%
TG: i dont want to talk about it
TG: imagine the worst day of my life
TG: just stood up and clinked a glass like it was about to give a speech
TG: then took a shit in my dinner and passed out with its pants down
%
TG: yeah
%
TG: stfu
TG: what are you doing
%
TG: ok
%
TG: i need some advice
TG: my kernelsprite which was this brainless feathery asshole with a sword in it
TG: turned into this bigger like ghostly feathery asshole
TG: with a sword in it
TG: it seems to want me to prototype it again
TG: not sure what to do
%
TG: shes asleep for some reason
%
TG: yeah i saw her there
TG: all tuckered out
TG: like she got smacked in the face with a pillow case full of the snooze wizards beard dander
TG: cause obviously its fuckin prime time for swiping some shuteye about now
TG: like a few hours into her magic stupid quest
TG: anyway what do you think
%
TG: ok fine but
TG: it seems to be suggesting something here
TG: and
TG: i guess im kinda weirded out by its suggestion
%
TG: ok well it definitely sounds like youre fucking something up over there
TG: but alright later
%
TG: WAIT
%
TG: dont go yet
TG: somethings up
%
TG: ok its me from the future
%
TG: its me
TG: i just appeared
TG: from the future
TG: wearing a rad suit
TG: he says dont go
TG: or youre gonna die
%
TG: he says i dunno gullible enough to trust a leetspeaking troll who wants you dead and strap on a rocket pack cause she said to
%
TG: ok that was probably the dumbest thing you ever said just now
%
TG: do you hear what youre saying oh my god
TG: this guy is me if i get him to talk to you youre just talking to me again jesus it proves nothing
%
TG: john stop being a tool and unbuckle yourself from that piece of shit
TG: if our friendship means anything youll listen to me and past dave
TG: this is future dave by the way
%
TG: yeah exactly why would i bother
TG: this sort of cornball horseshit is your cup of tea not mine
TG: dont make me track you down through time and stop you in person
%
TG: oh god did you just blast off
%
TG: ok well just dont ok
TG: im turning this timeline over to past dave
TG: and helping you all stay alive and do this thing the right way this time
TG: just stay on the goddamn ground for fucks sake
%
DAVE: hey
DAVESPRITE: sup
%
DAVE: who were you talking to
DAVESPRITE: just telling a troll to step off
DAVE: ok cool
DAVE: so now that youre a sprite
DAVE: do you know everything about the game
DAVESPRITE: well i knew a lot anyway
DAVESPRITE: cause im from the future
DAVESPRITE: but yeah i know more stuff now
DAVESPRITE: like things meant specifically for sprites to clue players in on
DAVESPRITE: but packaged in these like
DAVESPRITE: i guess riddles
DAVESPRITE: im supposed to be cagey about it
DAVESPRITE: but i dont really feel like it
DAVESPRITE: ask me anything go ahead ill give you a straight answer
DAVE: alright
DAVE: here goes
DAVE: why are we so fucking awesome
DAVESPRITE: thats the best fucking question anybody ever asked
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: so is everything cool with this john business
DAVE: is he gonna be ok
DAVESPRITE: thats up to him
DAVESPRITE: if he decides to wise up and listen to us
DAVESPRITE: if not then we just bail everyone out yet again
DAVE: ok
DAVESPRITE: all that gear you picked up should let you breeze through the first couple gates
DAVESPRITE: even at a low level
DAVESPRITE: later youll unlock the ability to bring your sprite down with you
DAVESPRITE: and well take care of shit together
DAVESPRITE: til then i guess just mess around and let jade build up or whatever
DAVESPRITE: ill go kill some time
DAVESPRITE: maybe draw some comics
DAVE: like what
DAVESPRITE: i dont know
DAVESPRITE: whats the last one you did
DAVE: i was in the middle of the nancho party arc
DAVESPRITE: oh yeah
DAVESPRITE: i gave up on that half way through
DAVE: yeah that was sorta the plan
DAVE: making a ten part story about nachos was always a bullshit idea
DAVESPRITE: lets do some brainstorming later
DAVESPRITE: blow everyones minds
DAVE: yeah sure
%
TG: did you blast off like a spazzy douche yet or what
%
TG: god dammit what do i have to do to make you believe me
TG: fist bump my future self til i got bloody knuckles and write you an even sappier bday note in my own blood
TG: on a back to the future poster
%
TG: oh ok
TG: so you believe me then
TG: about future me
TG: and like
TG: him turning into a floating sword bird
%
TG: oh man and if weve just concluded anything its that talking to those dbags should be priority number one so yeah go right ahead
%
TG: wow ok
TG: youre a little early
TG: but thats fine i guess
TG: also you suck at rockets
%
TG: what
%
TG: who
%
TG: dude you did go through the second gate
TG: i mean i dont know why you would listen to her again
TG: kind of moronic but thats a whole other issue
TG: she didnt trick you this time
%
TG: what were you expecting
TG: this is how it works
TG: the progression of gates is like this whole round robin thing
TG: cycling through each planet
TG: gate 2 on your planet leads to gate 2 on roses
TG: then you build up to gate 3 above her house which leads somewhere else on her planet
TG: you look for gate 4 somewhere there
TG: which leads to gate 4 above my house
TG: and so on
%
TG: ordinarily rose would have already gone through her gate 1
TG: but shes sleeping pretty hard obviously
TG: and ordinarily you wouldnt have gone through gate 2 until her house was built up
TG: so you wouldnt fall to your death
TG: but you got your cheat rocket so thats fine
TG: see we all got to coordinate on this thing
%
TG: fuck
TG: come on dude
%
TG: god dammit
TG: i am the real dave
TG: you know the one who saved your life
TG: im more real actually cause ive been through some heavy shit already hopping around on red hot gears and i-beams for like a year
TG: and grinding shit out for your ungrateful ass
TG: here look check out this code from the future not that you deserve it WIin189Q
TG: youre fucking welcome
%
TG: yo
%
TG: what did you do
%
TG: ahahahahaha
%
TG: pff
TG: dont worry about it
%
TG: cause i wouldnt give a shit
TG: and hes me
%
TG: what
TG: really
%
TG: ok
TG: dont go anywhere
TG: im coming down to the computer
%
TG: dave is here he wants to use the computer
TG: probably to help you scope out roses room and snoop and stuff
TG: i mean thats what i would have done
TG: if you were alive
TG: so im gonna go
TG: use these flappy ghost wings and tear shit up in space or something
%
TG: what
%
TG: yeah
%
TG: ok i dont know what youre doing here
TG: but i think we can both agree that youve got to rummage through as much of her shit as possible before she wakes up
%
TG: dude no come on
TG: shes out like a light anyway
TG: it was some like weird future thing that happened that made her sleep
%
TG: yeah
TG: shit doesnt get more clear than that
%
TG: fine dont
TG: but here just do this one thing
TG: see those two notebooks on the floor behind you
%
TG: you dont have to read them im not telling you to
TG: what kind of prying tool do you take me for
TG: just pick them up
TG: you know like tidy up a bit since you made a royal fucking dump of her room just now
%
TG: now i need you to do something else
TG: this is important
TG: like for important game reasons and stuff
TG: take the card the books are on
TG: flip it over
%
TG: so you can see the code
%
TG: dude you dont have to tell me the code
TG: just flip it over and let me know if theres a code there thats all
%
TG: alright cool
TG: you can ditch the books now if you want
TG: maybe put them back on the floor
TG: so rose doesnt think you were snooping
TG: seriously youve got some grubby fingers bro why dont you mind your own business there
TG: what is even with you
%
TG: isnt that your birthday package there
%
TG: maybe you should look at it
TG: i dont think it counts as snooping since its technically yours
%
TG: whoa why are you burning your wizard fanfiction
%
TG: oh ok
TG: then why are you burning that
%
TG: is that some dumb wizard thing you just made up
TG: or something to do with tentacle monsters
TG: i cant keep track of what you like anymore
%
TG: john told me
TG: he was all snoopin around your room while you were asleep and i was like no man dont
TG: so not cool
TG: then he was like haha dude check it out this book is full of wizard slash
TG: and i was like i dont even want to know this is such a crazy violation of privacy
%
TG: do you want me to chew him out about it i will because that was so outrageous i dont know where he got off being like that
%
TG: i thought you hated wizards
TG: whats the deal with that
%
TG: oh man thats so messed up
TG: that you think that
TG: she probably digs wizards for real just like you and youre blowing shit out of proportion like pretty much always
TG: you and she could probably have been chatting up how awesome wizards were this whole time but no
TG: youre probably burning your nutjob meow book to spite her too arent you
%
TG: oh yeah
TG: i thought that was a joke
TG: when did they say that
%
TG: you mean when we were dancing and stuff in our dreams
%
TG: ive never seen or heard these things in my dreams
%
TG: uh yeah
%
TG: no what a ridiculous question
%
TG: ....
%
TG: ........
%
TG: ..........................
%
TG: dunno
TG: anyway yeah i guess ill do that
TG: get some sky monsters to boss me around sounds cool
%
TG: so really why are you burning that
%
TG: no i know
TG: im using daves spare computer i saw the whole conversation through his pesterchum account
%
TG: i just mean
TG: you didnt burn that book in the future
TG: that book was completely pointless
%
TG: so does that mean the sleeping thing worked
TG: you remember the future
%
TG: ok cool
TG: so why is the cat code so terrible now
%
TG: well ok i guess its done but why are you so sure theyre right
%
TG: i guess not
TG: but they sort of freak me out
TG: i mean listening to gross space mutants all day isnt my idea of an awesome time
TG: especially the ones that sing oh god
%
TG: no i flip out to ill jams because they kick ass
TG: obviously
%
TG: yeah case the fuck closed
%
TG: are you talking to future me
%
TG: ok im out of the loop again
TG: between you taking orders from dream beasts and bird wing me with like
TG: future secrets
TG: im doing some sort of spectacular fucking jackknife off the loop and getting a wink and a nod from barack obana
TG: im coming upstairs
%
DAVE: so it was pretty funny how i made a copy of roses evil book right before she burned it and now she doesnt know about it
DAVESPRITE: i know its crazy what kind of foresight this guy has
DAVESPRITE: im telling you coincidences like that are unreal they dont even happen
DAVESPRITE: most of the time
DAVE: the best thing about how i did that is how it in no way will ever come back to bite us in the ass ever
DAVESPRITE: dude our shit is SAFE
DAVE: so safe
DAVESPRITE: gonna sleep pretty sound tonight
DAVESPRITE: with that big fucking payload of safety you just got dropped on us
DAVESPRITE: gonna be all huggin my pillow and shit
DAVESPRITE: grinning like a goddamn bear full of honey
DAVE: safer than some flintstone vitamins in a bottle
DAVE: keep twisting junior all you get is clicks
DAVESPRITE: asshole thinks its candy
DAVESPRITE: doesnt even know he just stepped on a security rake and got a face full of fucking safety
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: anyway guess ill go back down and burn that book
DAVESPRITE: alright
%
TG: what
%
TG: fuck off
%
TG: youre the annoying blind one arent you
%
TG: dave told me about you
%
TG: man im telling you burns like that are unreal
TG: where do you even get a burn thats that sick
%
TG: no you messed that up
%
TG: uh
%
TG: did you try to draw shades on his face and miss
TG: whats even the point hes already wearing shades
%
TG: this is moronic
%
TG: i dont know what it smells like or tastes like
TG: but i sure as hell know what it looks like
TG: like a fuckin symphony on my retinas
TG: shit is beautiful like a little vermilion picnic on my hands
TG: every day i open my eyes i find poetry in even the simplest things
TG: just one of those little joys in life you take for granted you know
TG: this miraculous gift of vision
%
TG: i could give myself a hernia trying to be as big a douche as that guy
TG: i could try but it would wind up like a motorcycle stunt gone horribly wrong
TG: my broken body would flop and tumble around like a rag doll
%
TG: and yet as much as that guys the tooliest dude i could ever hope to meet he and i would still get along famously
TG: cause we can both see
%
TG: just him and me
TG: havin a see party
TG: like a couple of eagle eyed bros peepin shit up into the wee hours
%
TG: i guess but youll have to be careful not to stumble around bumping into all the gorgeous masterpieces hanging around everywhere
TG: god so beautiful to look at with my perfect eyesight
%
TG: yeah thats fine
%
TG: oh hell
%
TG: that
TG: ok thats pretty amazing
%
TG: hey speaking of which
TG: where is my bro anyway
TG: havent seen him at all since i got here
TG: davesprite doesnt know
TG: you can see everything that goes on right
TG: or like smell it or whatever
TG: how does that even work
TG: how do you use a computer and know whats going on it doesnt make sense
TG: my face doesnt make sense
%
TG: hahaha
%
TG: ew
%
TG: oh ok
TG: so the dumbest and most far fetched explanation imaginable ok got it
%
TG: man dont remind me about that
TG: so embarrassing
%
TG: ok cool
%
TG: whos upset
TG: bout time the dude gave me a little space
%
TG: i guess
%
TG: alright so whats next

TG: why would i be scared
%
TG: we have cotton candy dumpass
%
TG: hey
%
TG: has it
%
TG: man who cares
TG: i mean thats great and all
TG: but i talked to you plenty more times since that from where im standing
TG: ive got to make this quick
%
TG: fuck no fuck that trollian horseshit
TG: its just regular old time travel
TG: im from the future
%
TG: no
TG: just regular ordinary dave from the fucking future nothing special dude come on
%
TG: yeah ok it is awesome but im in a hurry
%
TG: i need to borrow some boondollars off you
%
TG: no they do do something
%
TG: what do you think they buy shit its fucking money
%
TG: i cant answer all these questions dude youll find out anyway its not like youll even really need your money
TG: you you might as well give it to me
%
TG: all of it
%
TG: man you just said you thought it was useless why do you care
%
TG: ill pay you back
%
TG: in the future
TG: if theres one thing im not short on its the fuckin future
%
TG: yeah we do
TG: but chronologically ive been around for at least triple that
%
TG: no shit your deal is wind not time
TG: youre on easy street what is there even to think about with wind
TG: like what angle to blow it at to fly a damn kite or how gentle its gotta be to make a picnic go swimmingly
TG: its kiddie bullshit time is serious fucking business
TG: leave it to the pros ok
%
TG: yeah it can work that way
TG: or not
TG: ive been very careful
TG: this whole operation is strung together with stable time loops
TG: no timeline offshoots cause thats when daves start dying and that isnt no good for nobody
%
TG: yeah
TG: there are a bunch of daves running around the timeline
%
TG: but they are all me
TG: i mean they will all become me and ill become them one way or another
TG: thats how stable time loops work shit takes a lot of planning and precise choreography
TG: ive got some help though
%
TG: yeah
%
TG: man dont even get me started with that
TG: the 24 hour span of the reckoning is like some kind of critical spike in us dealing with troll bullshit
TG: i guess its just when the most shit is going down so they figure thats the best time to mess with us
%
TG: i dont know man they seem to flock to me
TG: ive been laying waste to chumps nonstop
TG: its like they heard somebody over here was handing out asses and theyve known nothing but years of bitter ass famine
%
TG: oh you know
TG: noirs outta control
TG: rose is crazy jades crazier and youre
TG: well youre you
TG: and together were up to our bulges and miscellaneous bullshit alien physiology in hot sloppy shenanigans while hatching plans under our feathery asses like a bunch of cage free farm fresh motherfuckers
TG: but im not about to get into specifics cause this is complicated enough as it is
TG: and if i started ranting too much about the future id start sounding like one of these smug alternian shitheads and im not about to drop that retarded science on my good bro
TG: so im staying on track here
TG: speaking of which
TG: give me your money
%
TG: oh christ
TG: only one
TG: well fuck nevermind then
TG: i thought youd have more by now but thats goddamn peanuts
%
TG: i mean
TG: ill take it anyway but damn

TG: im working the system here
TG: using time loops to manipulate the incipispheres financial sector
TG: making a goddamn killing in the lohacse
%
TG: lohac stock exchange

TG: yeah i mean
TG: i cant possibly argue with any of that
TG: so are we done making money yet or what
%
TG: yeah i kinda figured
%
TG: im not complaining
TG: but you said there was something specific we were working toward here
TG: i mean aside from buying up all the nastiest fraymotifs
%
TG: competitive
TG: man
TG: dont matter what i do im not gonna outpace egbert
%
TG: hey its not like the futures a mystery or anything weve both seen it
TG: well

TG: youve just caught a whiff of it
TG: like a hungry beggar loitering cross the street of an olive garden
TG: just cause a filthy vagrants barred from entry dont mean a dude doesnt know italian foods nearby its a fucking fact to his nose

TG: your leader
TG: thats a retarded thing to say even by the standard of your own bullshit made up vernacular
%
TG: whos he really
TG: your boyfriend or something
%
TG: ok asking for an explanation on that is pretty much the exact opposite of what im doing
TG: and interesteds the opposite of what im being
%
TG: ok that remark was almost as boring as it was weird
%
TG: haha
%
TG: i dont cry

CTG: but what else is new just another lady from outer space mackin on me whatever chance she gets
%
CTG: pretty sure she is
CTG: or he thinks she is or something
CTG: made it pretty obvious when he started ranting at me months ago
CTG: back when i suspected these trolls were full of shit
CTG: but now look how far weve come
CTG: theres not any doubt left about that at all
%
CTG: right
CTG: sounds like its time to get a clue she is over you dude
%
CTG: john god dammit stop embarrassing us
CTG: first of all weve got to be on record here as not giving a shit about that
CTG: second obviously theres gonna be 4 quadrants come on
%
CTG: k then bye
%
CTG: sounds like a loudmouth inferiority thing going on here to me
CTG: like you dont want to acknowledge that your troll ladies find a couple of human dudes irresistible
%
CTG: smooth
%
CTG: i dunno
CTG: do you like her
%
CTG: yeah ok
CTG: but i mean
CTG: anything more than that
CTG: like
CTG: if earth wasnt destroyed and she werent in some other universe on a planet full of unspeakable frothing dipshits
CTG: and she was on earth visiting your town or something
CTG: would you want to ask her to go see one of your dumbass movies
CTG: like the new maconnohey jam where he smirks and like all but deliberately draws the audiences ire like a goddamn magnetron
%
CTG: doesnt concern you dude
%
CTG: i dunno man doesnt sound like you really got our interests in mind here
CTG: you just sound kinda bitter
CTG: did one of the human ladies reject you
%
CTG: how did it go did you stand in a quadrant like you were playing four square
CTG: holding a bucket full of flowers or slime or whatever and jade was like no thanks bro
CTG: is that how it went down
%
CTG: or maybe it was a guy who rejected you
%
CTG: haha wow bingo
CTG: see how i look right now thats a poker face might want to take some notes
%
CTG: oh god stop talking about my lips thats the second time
CTG: ok youre clearly gay and youve probably got some issues about it dude
CTG: john just a heads up in the future i think youre gonna spurn one of his awkward advances

%
CTG: thx for the shipping grid bro imma drop everything and go have a baby with jade right now

%
TG: what
%
TG: oh god thats right
TG: you were the best troll
TG: i remember now
%
TG: yeah
TG: i mean
TG: in the most ironic and hilarious ways possible
TG: but that really shouldnt even need to be said
%
TG: it was months ago for me
TG: you did your bizarrely oblivious juggalo thing
TG: then bitched and moaned at me for ruining your religion or some horseshit
TG: like i guess a weird crisis in faith i dunno
TG: and then
TG: you kinda got over that i guess
TG: and we both proceeded to have one of the best rap-offs in the history of paradox space
TG: remember
%
TG: could be time shit
TG: you might not have had the conversation yet
%
TG: do you remember if you watched any videos
TG: from earth
TG: that i might have sent
%
TG: dude i was telling you
TG: youve got to check this out
TG: trust me itll lift your spirits shit will all make sense to you finally
TG: youll finally figure out who you are and why you worship all this ridiculous clown bullshit
%
TG: and also why your planet has faygo for some baffling reason
TG: actually no nevermind it doesnt explain that
TG: that still makes no damn sense

TG: more chock full than sad trollian villains cloggin my blocklist
TG: so thoughtful to popul-

%
TG: whats it look like
%
TG: so am i
TG: bow down before your new king bitch
%
TG: please dont say this party started please dont say this party started
%
TG: god everything is about parties with you
%
TG: ok
TG: lets see some fine art then
%
TG: ok that
TG: is every bit as shitty as all your other drawings
%
TG: i like it though you dont gotta improve
TG: art skills are overrated
%
TG: its kind of weird though what the hell is actually going on here
TG: does this mean something
%
TG: yeah
TG: but
TG: why
%
TG: alright but
TG: i mean even if that made sense which it kind of doesnt
TG: karkat was saying how it was all a game and youre just flirtin and stuff
TG: and that we should quit it because he doesnt want you in my grill or me in yours or whatever
%
TG: well yeah thats what i thought too
TG: and really if we got no other reason keep rolling with it at least theres that one
TG: to piss him off
%
TG: im not saying i know for sure but it seems to me like
TG: my grill is your goddamn prison
TG: you are practically incarcerated in that fucker
TG: doing hard time on a bed of charcoal and lighterfluid
TG: privy to what i flame broil from below
TG: what im sayin is you got a front row seat to the brown side of my burger
TG: hows it smell btw
%
TG: yeah i thought so
TG: so is that whats going on
%
TG: is this some weird game involving flirtation and assassinations or whatever
%
TG: thats pretty much the most insulting thing possible to say im anything like that raving gulf of shit
%
TG: issues
TG: what are you talking about
%
TG: wow ok what does that have to do with me
%
TG: i dunno i guess maybe when i become future me
%
TG: fuck who cares
TG: like i even give a shit about being a hero whatever that even means
TG: im not seeing the problem here future me is awesome he can bail me out if he wants
%
TG: not gonna happen
%
TG: hey look at this change of subject going down
TG: about this comic
TG: are you saying im about to fall asleep
%
TG: why
%
TG: i dont feel tired
TG: could be rose waking me up again
TG: bonkin me with yarn or some shit
%
TG: can you see in my dreams
%
TG: too bad
TG: last time i promised rose id take off my shades and look in the sky for some reason
TG: youre gonna miss a hell of a show
%
TG: so i guess i have to summon davesprite too
%
TG: whys that
%
TG: huh
TG: ok
%
TG: yeah kinda
TG: didnt think this useless horseshit was boss grade loot to be honest
%
TG: ok see ya
%
DAVE: sup
DAVESPRITE: hey
%
DAVESPRITE: oh looks like you got caledfwlch
DAVESPRITE: you found that pretty fast
DAVE: is that how you pronounce that
DAVESPRITE: yeah i guess so
DAVESPRITE: i think its welsh
DAVE: what are welsh things doing in this game
DAVESPRITE: thats an awesome question
DAVE: fuck yeah it is
DAVE: is this thing as pointless as i think it is or do i need it for something
DAVESPRITE: tactically yeah its a downgrade since its what i used to make caledscratch which is obviously way better
DAVE: yeah thats what i figured
DAVESPRITE: caledscratch cycles the sword through its own timeline to points when its broken or nonbroken or old and rusted or recently forged etc
DAVESPRITE: and your snoop snowcone swords probably even better than that so yeah you got options
DAVE: fuck it ill just power through the rest of the game with the SORD.....
DAVESPRITE: hahahaha
DAVESPRITE: with unreal air as a mount fit for a true artifact knight
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: goddamn jpeg hero
DAVE: right here
DAVESPRITE: did that shit ever land or what
DAVE: dude its long gone
DAVE: up in skaia now or something
DAVE: thrashing ill grinds on clouds
DAVESPRITE: fuck
DAVESPRITE: top priority make more
DAVESPRITE: thats an order from your celestial fuckin spirit guide
DAVE: yeah you got it
DAVE: so why wasnt this legendary pos in the sylladex you gave me
DAVE: did you chuck it after you alchemized it
DAVE: should i just chuck it too
DAVESPRITE: it was stolen
DAVESPRITE: by one of hephaestus's minions
DAVE: hes the denizen right
DAVESPRITE: yeah lord of the forge
DAVE: isnt that like a greek god
DAVE: or roman or whatever
DAVE: what is greco roman shit doing in here you know what never mind
DAVESPRITE: yeah pretty much
DAVESPRITE: anyway he gets pissed off you broke it
DAVESPRITE: and he wants it back
DAVESPRITE: to do something important with it though not really sure what
DAVESPRITE: hes a pretty ornery dude
DAVESPRITE: kept raving about how he was waiting for the forge to come
DAVESPRITE: which he needs to complete his work
DAVESPRITE: but in my timeline the forge would never come
DAVESPRITE: so he was extra pissed off
DAVE: whats the forge
DAVESPRITE: volcano
DAVE: huh
DAVE: you mean jades volcano
DAVESPRITE: yup
DAVE: so do you know this stuff cause youre from the future or cause youre a sprite
DAVESPRITE: both
DAVESPRITE: theres all sorts of stuff i suddenly knew about the game when i became this orange feathery asshole
DAVE: so now youre like
DAVE: a wise feathery asshole
DAVESPRITE: i am fuckin filthy with wisdom its sick
DAVESPRITE: i mostly know stuff about your personal quest
DAVESPRITE: what used to be my quest but i guess i got to deal with not being alpha dave no more
DAVE: yeah i guess
DAVESPRITE: shrug
DAVESPRITE: its all good
DAVESPRITE: anyway that sword
DAVESPRITE: its important to getting your shit figured out
DAVESPRITE: you were supposed to break it to get it out of the thing
DAVESPRITE: like another personal sort of mythological milestone you were supposed to clear
DAVE: really
DAVE: there was no other way to get it out
DAVE: thats kind of retarded
DAVESPRITE: well i dont know
DAVESPRITE: maybe if john was to try with his pure heart and shit it woulda popped out like a champagne cork and fuckin hero confetti woulda blasted him in the face
DAVESPRITE: but you
DAVESPRITE: we
DAVESPRITE: we had to break it
DAVE: ok
DAVESPRITE: theres a lot more i know about your quest
DAVESPRITE: all tangled up in ridiculous riddles and bullshit enigmas
DAVESPRITE: and maybe its all a moot point anyway in this timeline who knows
DAVESPRITE: but i think ill spare you all that crap
DAVESPRITE: cause its kind of boring
DAVESPRITE: and youll find out anyway
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: that sounds about like something id do if i were you
DAVE: which i am
DAVE: so hey
DAVE: apparently im about to fall asleep
%
DAVESPRITE: oh yeah why
DAVESPRITE: rose beckoning you again
DAVE: yeah probably
DAVE: anyway monsters will show up soon and try to eat my sleeping corpse
DAVESPRITE: yeah they werent too happy with my reckless indiana jones bullshit either
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: so thats where you come in
DAVESPRITE: i got your back dude dont worry
DAVE: ok
DAVE: guess ill make myself comfortable here
DAVESPRITE: when you wake up
DAVESPRITE: ill probably get going
DAVE: what do you mean
DAVESPRITE: ill just sort of
DAVESPRITE: release myself
DAVESPRITE: go do my own thing
DAVESPRITE: after this i dont think youll need me
DAVESPRITE: seems like youve got the stable time loop thing figured out already
DAVESPRITE: which means youll be alright
DAVESPRITE: future yous will get you out of trouble
DAVESPRITE: if youre gonna live up to the responsibility of eventually becoming them
DAVESPRITE: and by virtue of loop stability it sort of means you cant technically fuck up anymore
DAVESPRITE: but dont let that idea go to your head itll mess you up
DAVE: where will you go
DAVESPRITE: dunno
DAVESPRITE: fly around
DAVESPRITE: up away to the sun like a fucknig piece of gargbage
DAVESPRITE: see if i can catch up with bro maybe
DAVESPRITE: elusive bastard
DAVE: oh yeah
DAVE: where do you think he is
DAVE: what happened to him in your timeline
DAVESPRITE: who knows
DAVESPRITE: i completely lost track of him
DAVESPRITE: in that timeline and this one
DAVESPRITE: the dude is fucking inscrutable we both know that
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: ok good luck with that
DAVESPRITE: thanks man
%
?TG: ahahahahah oh god
?TG: dude i cant believe you were just getting on our case about hitting on the troll girls
?TG: and then literally the very next memo you are slobbering all over jade
?TG: thats just perfect hahahaha
%
TG: nak nak nak
%
TG: nak nak nak nak nak nak
%
TG: nakka nakka nak
%
TG: MY GLASSES ARE TALKING TO ME MY GLASSES ARE TALKING TO ME
TG: naknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknak
%
TG: hey
TG: welcome to the medium finally i guess
%
TG: ok i dont know what youre talking about it was probably just some horrorterror chirping at you during one of your nap bubble mindfucks
TG: its not the point i just wanted to say
TG: i just saw you
%
TG: yeah
TG: you appeared for a second
TG: shooting at an imp
TG: then you disappeared
%
TG: no you can kill them
TG: youll get better dont worry
%
TG: three places
TG: i remember seeing you twice before in different locations
TG: but at the moment im standing in the middle of this snowy goddamn field freezing my shit off
TG: just wanted to see if you were cool
%
TG: no i was
TG: this is future me
TG: one of the future mes that is
%
TG: yeah jade thats what future me means
%
TG: yeah
%
TG: its ok
TG: hey its pretty fucking cold
%
TG: so im gonna go some place warm be back in a while later
%
TG: ok im back
TG: an hour later
%
TG: an hour for me
TG: a second for you
TG: i ran around for an hour got my ass some place warm
TG: went back in time
TG: picked up where we left off
%
TG: yeah
TG: i guess im sorta used to it by now i dont think of hours going by the same way anymore
TG: i mean
TG: they are my hours but not everyone elses theyre kind of like private hours all to myself
TG: while everyone else is sort of in slow motion stuck in the thick of the alpha
%
TG: well yeah
TG: my thing is time yours is space
TG: pretty different things
TG: you GET things about space i dont
TG: or you will
%
TG: yup
%
TG: pretty believable since you lived on guam or wherever the fuck
TG: and also inside an active volcano
%
TG: well ive never seen it either now that i think about it
%
TG: no
%
TG: nah
TG: lavas better
%
TG: yeah it is lava and skeletal skyscrapers all melting and shit how is that not way cooler than
TG: snow and
TG: like
TG: more snow
%
TG: snows a big chilly carpet of nobody gives a shit
TG: like old man winter spread around his nasty mayonnaise and turned the landscape into his personal asshole sandwich
%
TG: when i look around all i see is the miles of unharnessed snowmen im just too damn cool to build
%
TG: whoa jade with the fucking haymaker
TG: i need to go look for my teeth on the canvas as soon as shit stops spinning and there stops being like ten of you
%
TG: time
%
TG: time
%
TG: time then shades
%
TG: time
%
TG: time/shades lets go
%
TG: oh my fucking god
%
TG: im not gonna play in the snow
TG: maybe you missed those credentials i flashed which clearly stated me being too cool for that
TG: like federally too cool
TG: my coolness is named after a dead president plus his middle initial to make it sound extra legit
%
TG: ok
%
TG: i thought you were going inside
%
TG: well at least make some damn clothes
TG: something warmer why dont you alchemize some shit
%
TG: blew up
%
TG: i completely understand everything about that practically entirely
%
TG: no dont bother john
%
TG: hes on like his fuckin
TG: wind mission or whatever
TG: getting all his ridiculous magic cyclone powers on and realizing his huge blowy destiny
TG: as the chump of shoosh
%
TG: almost
%
TG: we all start out somewhere
TG: remember how i was scrambling up that tower to get that egg like an idiot
TG: what the hell was i doing
TG: i was like goddamn pooh bear in a tree reaching up his fat fuckin pooh paw for some mother fuckin honey
%
TG: so even though im awesome now at one point i was plausibly likened to an autistic stuffed animal
TG: and you even knew what to do
TG: you told me how it worked all christopher robinning my ignorant ass about that egg
TG: but i was all like IM A LITTLE BLACK RAIN CLOUD BITCH WATCH ME CLIMB
TG: so maybe youre startin out with more sense than me
%
TG: in any case egbert lost his computer and game disc
TG: so he cant do anything for you anyways
%
TG: probably some shit like thats what happened
TG: but youre not completely screwed
TG: we just have to think outside the box here
%
TG: yeah honestly i figured wed have to do something like this
TG: so i guess here we are doing it
%
TG: well youre my server player remember
%
TG: i need you to deploy something first
TG: in my apartment
TG: in a few hours ill go back there and we can continue this
%
TG: yeah
TG: as in a few seconds
TG: im back at my place now
%
TG: yeah
TG: now
TG: deploy the intellibeam laserstation
%
TG: no it costs practically nothing
TG: check out how much ive got
%
TG: its mostly pretty stupid and useless
TG: but itll come in handy here
TG: it reads captcha codes
%
TG: yeah
%
TG: some are too garbled and complicated
TG: the human eye cant decipher them
TG: needs sophisticated scanning technology
TG: and artificial intelligence to figure it out
%
TG: yeah well
TG: thats why this is so dumb
%
TG: i guess some captchas are so incomprehensible cause the game thinks it would be too cheap to let you duplicate them
TG: like an anti piracy measure
TG: so the solution to the anti piracy measure is to override the anti spam measure
%
TG: well yeah thats what captchas are for
TG: and theyre on the back of cards for a really good reason
TG: cause god knows the last thing youd want was some web bot being able to figure out the code for like
TG: a potted plant
TG: that would be fucking mayhem
%
TG: but in order to effectively cheat here weve got to open pandoras spam box
TG: and release the laserstation into the world with its leering intellibeam
TG: now no captcha is safe youll have bots signing up for email accounts and duplicating potted plants and shit
%
TG: basically robots are in control now
TG: which is good news and bad news
TG: the bad news is theyre all pornbots and theyve got LOADS of provocative material theyre just dying to share with us
%
TG: thats also the good news
%
TG: whats it look like
TG: im duplicating my server disc
%
TG: nah i told you were not bothering john
TG: hes got shit to do
TG: ill just install it
%
TG: dont see why not
TG: we have to get creative here
TG: this games already so far off the rails what else is there to do but improvise
%
TG: well he was
TG: he got you in didnt he
TG: but now hes not
TG: been a change of plans
TG: time to roll with it
%
TG: yeah more or less
TG: i never really studied how it went down all that closely
TG: i just figured when the time came to sort it out the right thing to do would be obvious
TG: like it is now
TG: managing the loops is a balance of careful planning and just rolling with your in the moment decisions
TG: and trusting they were the ones you were always supposed to make
TG: by now im pretty used to having my intuition woven into the fabric of the alpha timeline
%
TG: yeah i know
%
TG: thisll be the disc i use for your connection
TG: while the original will stay bound to roses connection
%
TG: well technically
TG: i will be your server
TG: and past me will stay as roses server
TG: which is to say present me will
TG: the one in the black suit
%
TG: he can keep managing her for a while
TG: until she sorta checks out soon and becomes totally useless
TG: then he can start hopping around time like i did
TG: make a ton of money and stuff
TG: eventually become me
TG: and become your server player
%
TG: yeah see its not hard to get the hang of
TG: in the meantime ill kind of loiter around this timeframe to help you out for a while
%
TG: dont worry about it just some more future stuff
TG: now i need you to go downstairs
%
TG: im just going to cut right to the chase and upgrade your alchemiter so you can avoid a lot of bullshit
TG: ill give you some codes and you can punch cards and slip em into jumper blocks
TG: which are really the exact same codes you first gave me when we upgraded my alchemiter
TG: which seems like a hella long time ago
%
TG: yeah but it kind of literally is for me
%
TG: few days i guess
%
TG: whatever
%
TG: nak nak nak
%
TG: THE GLASSES ARE TALKING AGAIN
TG: naknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknak
%
TG: :V
TG: :(
TG: hey
TG: what just happened
%
TG: oh yeah
TG: so shes here then
%
TG: is she ok what was going on there
%
TG: i guess i should catch up with her
%
TG: i am
%
TG: oh ok time travels involved
TG: thats all you needed to say everythings cool and under control then
%
TG: weird
TG: and kind of boring
TG: i was in your dream room for a while spying on you
TG: being all creepy and dream duplicitous and shit
%
TG: whats with your book collection
TG: or
TG: dream book collection
TG: all your books are bizarre and terrible
%
TG: nah
TG: but yeah i understand defending your collection i guess if you were in my dream room and talking shit about my awesome dream portraits of dream stiller and dream snoop or whatever wed have to have a fucking talk
%
TG: oh
TG: yeah
TG: i did
%
TG: horrible things
%
TG: yeah
TG: it was like
TG: peering through the dark portal of an eldritch red lobster
TG: and scoping out its all you can eat seafood buffet
TG: and
TG: when i saw them
TG: their voices became clearer
%
TG: i couldnt really focus on anything specific
TG: but
TG: in totality
TG: im pretty sure it was
TG: like
%
TG: a plea for help
%
TG: no it was disturbing
TG: so i slapped my shades back on
TG: went and perved up some sleeping girls room to take my mind of it
%
TG: oh god why would i want that
TG: im not about to get molested by calamari with fucking teeth
TG: use your powers and like
TG: stroke a mummys paw or some horseshit and open a dark channel
TG: tell them to keep their lecherous flagella to themselves
%
TG: whats that mean
%
TG: who cares if theyre getting killed
TG: theyre hideous and obnoxious
%
TG: oh ok cool
%
TG: oh shit youre kidding
TG: no really are you serious i didnt even notice
TG: fuck mind = blown
%
TG: ok
%
TG: what am i supposed to do
%
TG: like
TG: a treasure map
%
TG: why
%
TG: plot a course to what
%
TG: oh right the green sun ok
TG: wait sorry
TG: i mean the Green Sun my bad
%
TG: whats the deal with this thing
TG: i mean aside from giving jades dog his devil powers
TG: and by extension i guess jack
%
TG: yeah
%
TG: how big
TG: i need a sense of scale here
TG: is it like the size of our sun
TG: or bigger
TG: or is it only as big as like
TG: planet fucking jupiter
%
TG: ok thats pretty fucking big
TG: see how important that contextualization was now i know how fucking impressed i should be
TG: i mean hopy shit thats huge
%
TG: so ok i make a map to this thing
TG: with the help of a million rambunctious gross tentacle mutants
TG: and then i guess we go there for some reason
%
TG: why do we need a map
TG: cant they just
TG: tell us what direction its in
TG: point a spaceship that way
TG: blast off to adventure
%
TG: i can kind of get that time is messed up there
TG: with like loops and causality paradoxes and shit like that
TG: being the knight of time here
TG: not really sure why navigating the space would be a problem though
TG: space isnt my thing remember
TG: what is it like
TG: full of wormholes or something
%
TG: i thought you werent supposed to know shit about either
TG: seeing as youre the seer whatever that means
%
TG: fair enough
TG: so i take my map and fly to this thing
%
TG: ok you fly to it
TG: then what
%
TG: you mean with the quest youre sending him on
%
TG: is there anything you do thats not sending dudes on quests
%
TG: so hes got to get the cancer out of skaia right
%
TG: yeah
TG: so whats The Tumor do
TG: i mean the tumor
TG: jesus can we stop with the fancy colored text bullshit
%
TG: well ok you can keep doing it then
%
TG: ok cool what is it
%
TG: ok i wont say anything
TG: just tell me
%
TG: what the hell is a bomb doing in there
%
TG: first time for everything i guess
TG: seriously whered you get all this info
TG: did you get it all from the gods
TG: are these just a bunch of orders youre following
%
TG: what
%
TG: what you mean a troll
%
TG: sounds like a really credible dude sign me up for trusting everything he says
%
TG: oh so he knows everything
%
TG: even if he is omniscient which he probably isnt what if hes just lying
%
TG: whys he want to die
%
TG: wait
TG: what
%
TG: ok i get it now
%
TG: whoa fuck
TG: a suicide mission are you serious
TG: no bullshit thats not happening
TG: hey look suddenly everything we just talked about was useless because its time to make a plan that doesnt fucking suck
%
TG: oh
TG: haha yeah thats fine i guess
TG: those fuckers are all kinds of mad expendable
TG: way to leave me hanging there
TG: for someone whos saying lets cool it on the drama the whole i wont be coming back thing is a pretty theatrical bombshell
TG: for future reference
%
TG: yeah i know
TG: so when do i do my thing
TG: make this map
TG: which i guess is just like
TG: a solid black piece of paper
TG: this is going to be fucking stupid isnt it
%
TG: alright
TG: so
TG: dog it as long as possible
TG: then travel back to about now and go to sleep
%
TG: what
%
TG: no
%
TG: oh yeah terezi
TG: no shes cool
%
TG: its blossoming into an interspecies partnership in incredibly shitty cartooning
TG: what do you mean get her to trick someone into putting me asleep again
TG: when did that happen
%
TG: who did that
%
TG: god
TG: fuckin trolls
TG: too many of them who can even keep track of this shit
TG: which ones yours
TG: is it the absurd juggalo one that would be hilarious
%
TG: yeah see what i mean
%
TG: oh ok
TG: well im suddenly not interested so go talk to your fairy god troll
TG: ill be over here paving the way for your elaborate dream suicide
TG: when i feel like getting around to it i mean
%
TG: later
%
TG: ok
%
TG: what do you mean what
%
TG: but
TG: you know if im going to or not
TG: its lame for you to pretend theres any element of suspense here
TG: why dont you just tell me
%
TG: look i dont mind making the decision if thats whats going on here
TG: like doing the free will thing
%
TG: yes how would it ever stop being a thing
TG: being a things not something it ever stopped doing
TG: i just want to know whats really going on here
TG: before i decide to start choppin off the heads of outrageously good looking snoozing dudes
%
TG: ok i know but
TG: something about this doesnt add up
TG: who is this guy
TG: i dont remember sleeping on this bed
TG: or reaching the god tier im pretty sure thats something id remember
TG: so is he from the future
TG: does this mean later im going to have to put this ugly goddamn suit back on
TG: which i thought we both agreed id retired from the wardrobe forever
TG: and then go back in time and sleep in this bed and get killed by me right now
TG: do i have the stable loop right
%
TG: then what
%
TG: why wouldnt i be concerned about that
TG: if we make mistakes then dead daves start piling up
TG: and dead daves are the enemy remember
TG: says the sword holding guy whos about to add one to the pile
%
TG: who
%
TG: ok got it
TG: i wonder if this can finally be the conversation that doesnt deteriorate into a lot of bitching and moaning about her
%
TG: so if im understanding this
TG: this guy isnt from the future who came back to finish a loop
TG: and hes not from the past because id remember doing this
TG: so this isnt part of our timeline choreography at all
TG: must be from an offshoot timeline
TG: which means hes doomed
%
TG: ok so how did this happen where did we fuck up
%
TG: what exactly did you do
%
TG: yeah i remember
TG: that seems like a long time ago already
TG: what was that like more than a day for me chronologically
%
TG: ok but you didnt actually give me a choice
TG: you just flipped a coin
%
TG: ok stop that shit is probably like crack to you
TG: im not going to stand by and watch you fall prey to your own wild cherry apeshit apocalypse
%
TG: the arrangement being the coin flip thing
TG: thank god we did that otherwise wed be screwed
TG: i probably would have gone back in time and killed my own grandfather oh wait i never had one
%
TG: oh yeah
%
TG: twoface is a human batman villain whos half ugly and flips coins all the time to make evil decisions
%
TG: its ok flippin coins for reasons is still pretty badass i guess
TG: why dont you finish your story
%
TG: right exactly
TG: so like i said before i had no choice at all i picked some options and you flipped a coin
%
TG: not seein it
TG: i picked good heads to mean youd show me now
TG: bad heads to mean youd show me later
TG: you said it came up bad heads
TG: so i was like ok i can wait
TG: and i did for like a whole day
TG: and now here you are showing me
TG: did i miss something
%
TG: then
TG: this is kind of useless isnt it
TG: i thought you were bringing me back here to finish a stable time loop not murder a guy you punked whos gonna die regardless
TG: whats the fucking point of giving a doomed version of myself superpowers anyway
%
TG: its just the worst thing when you get morbid
%
TG: anyway maybe
TG: but i kind of doubt thats how it works i mean
TG: doomed means doomed doesnt it
TG: the loopholes are only temporary like look how davesprite turned out
%
TG: am i wrong in guessing that
TG: shouldnt you know better than me
%
TG: i dont know
TG: what does being a seer of mind actually mean
%
TG: oh ok its someone who asks a bunch of dumb riddles i figured it out already
%
TG: lets not get derailed here
TG: we were talking about a serious issue and im standing over my soon to be corpse while holding a fucking sword
%
TG: punishing
%
TG: i guess
%
TG: i dunno none of this is making for a very persuasive argument that i should kill doomed me
%
TG: see
TG: this shit youre doing now
TG: this is the morbid shit i was talking about
TG: its not anywhere near as endearing as you probably think
TG: even when you bracket smile after it
TG: like ok you said something fucked up but hey theres a cute face my heart just fucking melted
%
TG: ok yeah youre right i just got won back over totally
TG: i think
TG: this whole thing was a ruse
TG: and not even the funny kind that qualify as distactions
TG: i think you got my whole timeline there in front of you and you know damn well i have no intention of killing this guy ever
TG: and its just a big game you set up to watch me squirm over weird mortality issues while you giggle
%
TG: so
TG: i guess
TG: well played??????
TG: i dont know
TG: just one question
TG: and please just drop your fucking justice riddles and be honest
TG: do i ever make the god tier
TG: like the right way
%
TG: ok
TG: then cool i guess i can live without wearing a sweet windsock hoodie and making time tornadoes or whatever
TG: i was only bugging you about it cause you were being so vague
%
TG: alright then
TG: i guess thats enough of this horseshit time to move on right
%
TG: i dont even want to be around when he wakes up itll be weird and awkward
%
TG: no fuck no
TG: put your fucking death coin away jesus
TG: i am forbidding you from ever flipping that coin again when youre talking to me or even thinking about me
%
TG: what you didnt
%
TG: thats fucking idiotic
TG: you could smell a flea off a dogs balls
%
TG: this is bs
TG: so ok your coinflip of death was meaningless great to know
TG: is there anything else we need to do here
TG: i sent you the money i got all the fraymotifs tell me what is there thats left besides you jerking me around
TG: probably time we chill out for a while and i get back in sync with my teammates
%
TG: then i guess thats where ill go
%
TG: ok
TG: i mean
TG: im not even actually mad i just
TG: i dunno
%
TG: i still dont really get what you did
TG: was the trick really necessary
TG: it sounds like
TG: the splitoff was a result of both possible decisions i could have made
TG: and had fuckall to do with your coin or randomness or luck
%
TG: get what
%
TG: yeah
TG: and
TG: i obviously still dont know
%
TG: i dont know sounds like a riddle
TG: fuck it ill just say all of it
TG: i mean that is the answer right
%
TG: oh ok
%
TG: really well
TG: i know it biblically its an obscene nsfw spectacle
%
TG: means my skull is a bucket and my brains a plump fuckgrub
%
TG: oh do you
%
TG: is that what you were doing just now
%
TG: yeah no fuck
%
TG: man
TG: you are just
TG: some kind of knowitall arent you
TG: what else do you know
%
TG: like
%
TG: yeah because
TG: you didnt even look
TG: it was like
TG: schrodingers fucking coin
TG: and then
TG: it turned into schrodingers fucking dave
%
TG: yeah
%
TG: what
%
TG: yes perfect
%
TG: ok im going to torrent you another like negative billion artifact grists
%
TG: yeah
TG: now draw the conksuckiest boot you ever drew
%
TG: its the conksuckiest piece of fucking shit that ever still somehow qualified as a boot
%
TG: you just know imigrants were responsible
%
TG: yeah see what i mean
%
TG: well that was apparently pointless
TG: now what
TG: hello
TG: terezi
TG: whats up
%
TG: this is a dave out there whats up
%
TG: it wasnt a future dave he was from a while ago
%
TG: sorry you had to see that
TG: but dont worry it was just a doomed dave no big deal really
TG: i was swindled into splitting time paths along the way and that guy got the dead end of the stick
TG: ill be fine
%
TG: yes you are go ahead and be relieved
%
TG: nice
%
TG: yeah
TG: hes pretty much the guy in charge of random teleportation murders right now
%
TG: what
TG: my bro
TG: yeah jack killed him too
%
TG: not much to talk about
TG: this is some pretty serious existence threatening shit going down and some people are going to die i guess
TG: even crazy hard dudes like my bro slash weird covert biological ghost dad
%
TG: yeah roses too
TG: i thought john filled you in on the ectobiology stuff
%
TG: bottom line is were all related slimewise except you and me and him and rose pairways respectively
TG: makes the shipping chart pretty simple here hang on while i dig up that piece of shit karkat made
TG: where the fuck did that thing go
TG: fuck it never mind
TG: just imagine something ugly made by a jackass
%
TG: i guess
%
TG: meh it was a pretty bizarre relationship by any standard
TG: fightin off wave after wave of face pumicing puppet ass every day
TG: always being on guard for stealth attacks in the middle of the night while getting up to go to the fucking bathroom
%
TG: but i guess it all sorta amounted to some vague unspoken semblance of kinship
TG: if thats a thing
TG: like if honor among thieves is something then lets call it camaraderie among ironic rapping roof ninjas
TG: but thanks
%
TG: i thought about taking his sword
TG: when i was there
TG: but i couldnt
TG: couldnt really bring myself to try to pull it out it was too weird
%
TG: what
%
TG: you think
%
TG: well id like to
TG: but im still trapped in the chronologistics of this fuckin one man ballet
TG: there are loops outstanding and if i step out of line you get to see more bloody daves
TG: im getting pretty sick of it but i think itll be over soon
TG: then ill break out and ride linear the rest of the way i think
TG: once its time to put the end game in motion
TG: til then youre on your own for a while
%
TG: besides we cant beat him
TG: look what he did to bro and davesprite together
TG: im at the top of my echeladder with all the fraymotifs and i stand no chance
TG: johns even better than that even though he doesnt know it at the moment
TG: and he stands no chance either
TG: only thing we can do is hold out until the scratch
%
TG: guess i shouldnt really say
TG: since you sort of lead the way in making that plan
%
TG: yeah well
TG: suffice to say
TG: if we cant beat him
TG: all we can really do is exile him to a place where he cant teleport back
TG: which hopefully buys us some time
TG: to try to take out his power source in a crazy suicide mission
%
TG: kinda
%
TG: well
TG: youre about to do what youre about to do
TG: and im not going to tell you not to
TG: i wont do the bullshit troll thing and tell you what youre going to do and then just dare you not to
TG: while knowing damn well you will anyway
TG: so ill just say
TG: whats next is up to you
TG: and if later you want to talk about it
TG: im here
%
TG: hey
%
TG: christ
TG: youre a fan of one of my websites arent you
TG: what asshole gave you my chumhandle
TG: also what was your favorite thing i did you liked
TG: and what did you think was so great about it
TG: also
TG: asl???
%
TG: oh holy shit ok youre a troll
TG: only trolls say theyre six i dont know whats up with you and that dumb fake age
%
TG: makes no sense bye
%
TG: cool story
%
TG: ok so 2=6 awesome joke hahahaha
TG: or wait maybe it was just a waste of time
TG: you people think im made of the stuff
%
TG: what
%
TG: yeah
TG: i think
TG: im gonna shut off my phone now cya
%
TG: uh
TG: what
TG: the fuck
%
TG: i remember this
TG: i remember shutting off my phone and never talking to you again
TG: but
TG: im still talking
TG: whats going on
%
TG: no its a dream
TG: im asleep
TG: or am i
TG: what is going on here
%
TG: why
%
TG: bs
%
TG: i dont see anything out there
%
TG: oh sup
TG: looks like youre a fairy
%
TG: thats cool
%
TG: these arent my shades anymore
TG: john gave me these new ones for my bday
TG: i remember that
TG: and i wasnt wearing this shirt
TG: it was this one
TG: howd it get like that
%
TG: i cant
TG: wait
TG: i wasnt wearing this actually
%
TG: i was wearing this suit
TG: no wait
TG: it was a black one
%
TG: yeah
TG: and i was playing sburb
TG: thats right
TG: and then i went to sleep at some point
TG: which is why im asleep now
TG: but
TG: if im dreaming
TG: then why am i not awake as my dream self
%
TG: shit
TG: this wasnt the suit i was wearing
%
TG: it was this ugly fucking rag
%
TG: and i went to take a nap
TG: terezi said id reach god tier
TG: or i guess show me why i wouldnt
TG: did it work is this part of the process somehow
%
TG: so then
TG: its just a stupid pointless dream
%
TG: wait
TG: oh yeah
TG: i woke up
TG: and then
%
TG: welp
%
TG: so then
TG: im dead
%
TG: then this isnt a memory or a dream at all
TG: its the afterlife
%
TG: ok
TG: what is going on over here then
TG: is this some disturbing ghost hallucination should i start slapping myself or what
%
TG: i dont remember this
%
TG: fuck
TG: lucky bastard
TG: so then i guess terezi tricked me
%
TG: it would have been cool to know if picking one option would definitely kill me pointlessly so yeah
TG: but i guess i kept giving her shit about it and i knew she was kind of crazy and morbid anyways so whatever
TG: is
TG: bro dead there
%
TG: like in reality
TG: like thats a thing that really happened
TG: also
TG: is reality still a thing that means something can that be a question on the table too
%
TG: well
TG: dammit
TG: what did i do wrong
TG: aside from getting my ass killed in the most retarded way possible
%
TG: whats he doing
TG: alpha me
%
TG: i am him
%
TG: i dunno
%
TG: yeah
TG: sorta
%
TG: maybe
%
TG: ok
TG: am i talking to someone there
%
TG: who
%
TG: probably
TG: terezi i guess
%
TG: i dunno
TG: would she do that
%
TG: was i
%
TG: so
TG: im just one dead dave offered up to the time god
%
TG: what about the other dead daves
%
TG: uh
TG: i think
TG: im up to my neck in dave already
TG: just being one
%
TG: still doesnt seem right though
TG: why are you even here like why are you showing me this
%
TG: but like
TG: if im seeing this
TG: shouldnt i be able to do something about it
TG: or stop it from happening or
TG: i dont know like anything to keep helping my friends
TG: what do i do
%
TG: where are we now
%
TG: oh so this is the trollplanet
TG: pretty cool not really what i pictured
%
TG: i dont know its more subdued
TG: i pictured a lot more mayhem like
TG: a bunch of trolls flying around in little grub pods constantly screaming at each other through bullhorns shaped like buckets
%
TG: hahaha
%
TG: can we not go to those parts
%
TG: awesome
TG: so what am i supposed to do now that im dead
TG: what is like
TG: the primary activity here
TG: that ghosts get their shit worked up over
TG: like
TG: where are the fucking hauntoffs at is what im asking
%
TG: boring
%
TG: just kidding that sounds cool
%
TG: what else
%
TG: it isnt
%
TG: ha
TG: haha
TG: i bet you meant a laugh a whole lot less shitty than that
%
TG: yeah sure
TG: well
TG: how about later
TG: not that that doesnt sound cool but i kind of want to just go home
TG: and i guess chill for a while cause i guess it was all a bit much
TG: if thats ok and i guess also possible
%
TG: aw hell no
TG: is this who i think this is
%
TG: holy shit
%
TG: dude
TG: are those sick fires youre packing there
TG: you best not be bringin that fire into my bubble less you plan on dropping that shit
%
TG: i am your general fucking practitioner and doctors orders are to shut up and burn down my goddamn office
TG: ill break your brittle ass like a graham cracker and well roast smores over the flaming debris have i made myself clear
%
TG: dude
TG: gross
TG: so aradia just so were clear
TG: this is like a hellbubble right
TG: its my eternal punishment to have shitty rapoffs with this tool forever is that it
%
TG: i guess i had it coming for a flagrant lifetime spent being unbelievably fucking incredible at rap and just about practically everything else
TG: except not dying
%
TG: so is he dead
TG: he looks dead
%
TG: what about you
TG: you dont look dead
TG: are you dreaming
%
TG: so
TG: youre not dead
%
TG: oh my fucking god
%
TG: what do you mean what
TG: we just got done talking and agreed it would be awesome if you didnt bother me for a while
TG: you know like while i guess i grieved over this brutally murdered rad family member or something
%
TG: it was five seconds ago
%
TG: so youre officially going nonlinear with me then
TG: were just forfeiting all rhyme or reason to this unmitigated clusterfuck is that it
%
TG: whoops ok in the future ill try not to pitch any sort of dramatics while brooding over the cadavers of slaughtered loved ones
%
TG: no
%
TG: puppets arent cool theyre shitty small fake people who haunt your dreams and grin like permanent assholes
TG: i was making a joke about being all broken up about it
TG: a guy can be sad and make jokes at the same time
%
TG: exactly
%
TG: i said we agreed youd leave me alone to grieve
TG: didnt say whether i actually would or actually am
%
TG: i am grieving to the max like a widow on dead husband island
TG: behind these chill as fuck shades my face is having this crazy attack of the sads
TG: my rue is fucking bananas cant you tell
%
TG: the truth is a mystery
TG: tucked behind the pursed lips of a shitty riddler
TG: they will be loosened only when presented with the conundrous grandeur of rigid insoluble puzzlecock
%
TG: im sorry you are so flustered by the mere mention of glittering mythical cryptodick it honestly makes me think youre not ready for the truth
%
TG: its pretty simple
TG: im just thinkin about how im gonna take this sword
%
TG: filthiest thing you ever said
%
TG: forget it
TG: pulling swords out of things isnt how i roll
TG: im not john remember
%
TG: im not a hero
TG: my bro was
TG: john is
TG: im not
%
TG: no
%
TG: fine its a title we inherit as phlegm babies or whatever but what have i done to earn it
TG: pretty much nothing but horsing around through time and swindling retarded alligators out of their life savings
TG: if that swords coming out of his chest its coming out clean
TG: taking it vertically means drawing more blood
TG: but horizontally means a clean break
TG: check it
%
TG: no fuck that
TG: im a lie my ass right down here for a while looking slightly less cool than i make myself out to be ordinarily
%
TG: that is basically what i just did isnt it
%
TG: thats what im doing here im making a point of makin every little thing take place what was once mentioned in passing no matter how seemingly trivial or pointless
TG: thats how all the best adventures get strung together
TG: you havent heard me bleat like a goat for ironically humorous purposes yet have you
%
TG: that was something that was mentioned at some point by someone i forget when or why
TG: i bet you are on goddamn pins and needles waiting for that arent you
%
TG: no
TG: fuck that
%
TG: no
TG: fuck you
TG: go away
%
TG: what
%
TG: i dunno
TG: why are you even talking to me anyway
TG: aside from the fact that several hours from now you apparently forget i dont need consolation and oughta be left alone
%
TG: oh
%
TG: bitten
TG: what
%
TG: that sure sounds like a dumb way to say a thing
TG: almost egbertian in elegant stupidity
TG: the t in egbertian is soft like shhhhh
%
TG: why would i get mad at you
%
TG: ok
TG: but yeah i guess its about time you showed me whats up with my allegedly futile god tierification
TG: how long ago was it that you did your coin flip thing i dont even remember
TG: i was getting sure you were just bullshitting me and had no intention of ever mentioning it again
%
TG: for what
%
TG: before what happens
TG: you mean god tiering
TG: does something go wrong
%
TG: thats practically unthinkable
%
TG: but i mean ok we can talk about your troll problem but this is pretty important here
TG: the god tier thing and whether i can actually do it or not
TG: it might be kind of hard to tell on account of me chilling face down on the pavement and also because downplaying feelings is the chief rule of cool but im pretty pissed about this
TG: which is weird
%
TG: no its not weird to be mad its just weird it feels like im the only one who is
TG: and the only one even contemplating taking jack on
TG: even among your group of irate gnashing shitheads
%
TG: what
%
TG: well ok
TG: and that would be a bitchin line to switch the subject to start talkin about your complicated problems but i kinda wasnt done
%
TG: but ok i mean isnt that what heroes should be doing
TG: working to take down the bad guy without a whole lot of this fuckin grandiloquence and these huge sweeping plans that got nothin to do with fighting him
TG: like always biding our time and tiptoeing around the unbeatable god boss
TG: johns too nice to get mad
TG: rose spends all her time calculating
TG: too focused on machiavellian ploys of sabotage to try anything drastic
TG: jade is
TG: i dont even know
TG: probably more a liability if she got it in her head to take him down
TG: if anything id bet she just needs protection
%
TG: im just wondering
TG: when does someone actually step up
TG: jacks got shit to pay for
%
TG: yeah i guess
TG: i guess it has been on my mind
TG: maybe i am supposed to be a hero and rise to the occasion because there seems to be this little persistent voice in my head nagging me about it
TG: insisting someones gotta pay
TG: and its hard for me to disagree
%
TG: what things
%
TG: im pretty sure i dont even have an exile
TG: ive never heard any voices or anything
TG: anyway you dont need a voice in your head to tell you this shit is
TG: just like
TG: so completely illegal
%
TG: wait
TG: why did i just say that stupid thing i said
%
TG: no i mean
TG: ok that came out wrong
TG: what were we talking about again
%
TG: right
TG: someone has to make him pay
TG: cant let him just go unpunished
TG: if i can figure out how to reach the god tier maybe i can be the one to throw him into the slammer
%
TG: slammer means jail
%
TG: you call it the slammer when youre extra angry at crimes
%
TG: are you taking notes on this important principle?? jesus get a fucking pen
TG: or some chalk or whatever
%
TG: wait
TG: fuck
TG: what
TG: no
%
TG: i know it doesnt
TG: im just saying
TG: what am i even saying here
TG: shit
%
TG: ok forget the slammer stuff that was stupid
TG: it is about justice though
TG: and since no one else seems to give a shit about that it apparently falls in my jurisdiction now
TG: not just going after jack
TG: but all the mutinous agents responsible for crimes
%
TG: holy shit why do i care about THAT suddenly
%
TG: anyway thats more shit that popped into my head just now
TG: so
TG: ok
%
TG: not really
TG: no
TG: anyway
TG: its not like being mad about this and hankering for justice is even the only irrational thing im currently hot and bothered about
TG: i have other duties to attend to
%
TG: ive got to explode this ridiculously illegal edifice oh my god what are these words im saying
%
TG: never mind
%
TG: oh
TG: yeah
TG: thats gotta be what im talking about
TG: probably
TG: i need to shut up now
TG: im sounding like an idiot and my head is starting to hurt
TG: why dont we talk about your thing now
TG: what justice thing do you have to do
%
TG: yes
%
TG: just please tell me your justice problem and make me stop saying stuff
TG: farewell
%
TG: no i mean
TG: god damn it im not leaving
TG: farewell is not even a thing i would ever say jesus what am i a victorian poet
TG: can you show me a little respect and assume any time i say something stupid it just means im temporarily being inexplicably retarded
TG: thats what a real friend would do
%
TG: thank you
%
TG: that sounds awesome
%
TG: justice problems
%
TG: oh shit are you fucking serious
%
TG: no i got that theyre like your alien death lawyers who were sorta like bounty hunters in olden times pretty simple to decipher through context
%
TG: she
%
TG: ok i cant even make little interrogative quips to grease the wheels of your monologue
%
TG: spidertroll
%
TG: youve decided to take her down then
%
TG: you dont sound that psyched about it
%
TG: are you feeling guilty
TG: like second guessing whether she deserves it
%
TG: hasnt she done enough terrible shit to warrant legislaceration
%
TG: are you sure about that
%
TG: there is no john vs dave thing though
%
TG: are you going to stop me too then
TG: hunt me down and lawyerviscerate me for my own good
%
TG: are you saying that i wont make god tier or i wont be strong enough if i do
%
TG: what
%
TG: lame motion overruled the judge wants to see where this is going
%
TG: ok fine
TG: we can keep obsessing over your fucked up kismesister if you want
%
TG: do you think she stands a chance against him
%
TG: then whats the big deal
TG: why not let her go get her shit ruined by jack and let justice happen that way
%
TG: so why dont you go do it
%
TG: you mean you cant beat her in a fight
%
TG: i thought trolls were all about gratuitous murderings
%
TG: are
TG: you asking me to reassure you about that
TG: cause i seriously dont have a clue
%
TG: i dont understand
TG: i thought you were insane kinds of apeshit over the macabre stuff
TG: like being all cutesy about executions and smelling cherry blood and such things contrived to get a guy feeling vaguely uncomfortable
TG: was that all an act
%
TG: of course the fuck not
%
TG: didnt you say youve killed people before
%
TG: ok
TG: id like to help you out but i dont know what advice i should be giving
TG: to a member of a murderous species whos gunshy on going off to justicemurder a murderhappy murderer whose done lots of murders
TG: it feels pretty weird and inappropriate for me to be the one to tell you fuck yes go for it shes got this huge murder with her name on it anyways and its cruising right at her down comeuppance boulevard
TG: so i dont know
TG: do you want me to tell you to be a better human
TG: or to be a better troll
%
TG: alright well all ill say is
TG: maybe if you kill her at least we can finally stop obsessing over her
%
TG: why dont you just do what you think you have to do
TG: and ill do the same
TG: speaking of which
%
TG: these time shenanigans completely blindsided us they practically never even happen
%
TG: so i hang up now with future you and then start pestering present you about it is that how it works
%
TG: and i make sure not to reference anything said here to keep it simple
TG: except like in an offhand way thatll seem retroactively logical to your future self
TG: ie you right now
TG: if for no other reason than itd be boring as hell to rehash it
%
TG: does luck actually matter
%
TG: heres one for you
TG: its a whopper
TG: are you ready
%
TG: this huge fuckin whopper im about to just say
%
TG: what
%
TG: no no
TG: ok first do you even have burger kings out in the fucking woods
TG: why do you reference things that obviously arent in the woods like terrible burgers
%
TG: there is
TG: ok whatever
TG: im talking about a dream i just had
TG: i mean it was a doozy like psychologically speaking
TG: doozy is a slightly dumber word than whopper
%
TG: it was absurdly heavy handed my subconscious was really slathering it on
TG: like whatever tangy sludge the king himself squirts on his bargain patties
TG: its possible that i dreamt it ironically i dunno
TG: i figured youd be interested in hearing about it its every bit as thick and juicy as a half pound of sizzling grade A premium ok this is stupid weve got to get burgers out of this conversation
TG: are you busy
%
TG: cool listen to this
%
TG: no but this one is too good not to put under the microscope with your whole precocious psychotherapy shtick its almost laughably symbolic of all my mental problems assuming i actually have those
TG: its grotesquely pregnant with meaning
TG: all gestating at least 8 gooey octuplets thrashing around in an undulating belly full of mind slime
%
TG: no look
TG: i just want your professional take on how many things in my dream symbolize dicks
%
TG: yeah thats a given but i didnt even dream about puppets this time
%
TG: i know
TG: it was so much more relaxing and enjoyable
TG: it was about me dying repeatedly
%
TG: i was in this dark place surrounded by this big flock of crows
TG: god this is so generically morbid
TG: im sorry in advance for exposing you to my unconscious minds retarded cliches
%
TG: well obviously i knew the birds were just black screaming sky dongs just hear me out
TG: i kept dying
TG: there kept being these traps like i would go one way and get my head chopped off
TG: or go another way and get stabbed or whatever
TG: and every time i died the dream reset itself and i was standing there alive and ready to try to escape again
TG: but each time i would be watching myself from the vantage point of a different crow
TG: like i was the crow all squawking around in circles like a macabre flapping douche
TG: and i would always watch myself try to do something different to dodge the trap but i always ended up dead
%
TG: you mean maybe its about anxiety over maintaining my blogs
TG: or that my beats might not be ill enough
%
TG: and then we crack up laughing cause we both know theyre fresher than your moms change of drawers and tighter than when shes wearin them
%
TG: please its not like shes my mom i can visualize her choice ass all i want without it gettin much more than moderately uncomfortable for everyone involved
%
TG: about what
%
TG: uh
%
TG: this isnt the first time youve insinuated were related what is up with that
%
TG: no
TG: i mean
TG: im not sure
TG: i feel like youve brought it up before which is kind of weird but now i dont know
TG: i think im getting this weird deja vu thing where i was sure we talked about this
TG: forget it
%
TG: ok
TG: so i kept dying and kept being crows and stuff
TG: and then i started to notice something coming from the sky
TG: it was this faint eerie singing and i look up and theres nothing there just darkness
%
TG: what did you read
%
TG: what the fuck sort of crackpot psychology text would say something like that
%
TG: so then youre consulting astrology books now
%
TG: oh my fucking god will you put that away
%
TG: theres not even much more to it
TG: i looked up into the sky
TG: didnt see anyone singing
TG: but even though the sky was black i could see the sun
TG: it was bright as hell even through my shades
TG: so i flapped my wings and flew up away to it like a fucking piece of garbage
TG: and thats it
%
TG: no
TG: not in the sense that it was a dark sacrificial zoology mission
TG: it was more like somewhere to go besides watching myself die a lot from the vantage of a feathery murder of dumb shitty birds
%
TG: what the fuck are you talking about
TG: ok somethings wrong
TG: this whole conversation is falling apart this isnt how it originally went at all
%
TG: this happened months ago
TG: does this mean im dead
%
TG: stop it
TG: this is so sick you using the dream bubble bullshit to pick apart my psyche
TG: am i dead or asleep
%
TG: god dammit
%
TG: yeah right
%
TG: i dont know
%
TG: i remember waking up here
TG: after getting shot
%
TG: then the cage bunny came
TG: he gave us the bomb
TG: whered he go anyway
%
TG: the bunnys a she
%
TG: dumb
%
TG: we were talking about who should go
%
TG: no
TG: wait
TG: wasnt i going to go
TG: is that what happened did i go and now im dead
%
TG: whats not quite
TG: that i didnt go or that im not dead
%
TG: no
%
TG: sure
TG: i did that
TG: because i wanted to
TG: and because i was supposed to
%
TG: yeah i saw my future self fighting him so obviously that had to happen or else id be dead anyway
TG: without even getting the satisfaction of standing up to him
%
TG: hard to explain
TG: with all the time shit going on
TG: i dont try to understand your light shit do i
%
TG: havent we had this conversation already
%
TG: its jogging i guess
TG: its manboobs are jiggling a little
%
TG: what
%
TG: what am i really supposed to say
TG: hey were gonna hunt frogs til you shoot me through the jack
TG: then i die and youve got to make out with me
TG: that kind of changes how the whole thing goes doesnt it
%
TG: what does that even mean
%
TG: wtf
%
TG: aspd
%
TG: oh no
TG: this conversation just got bumrushed by a mudslide of fucking awful
%
TG: you dont know anything
TG: about what i was feeling or what happened on lofaf
TG: you were all pavement faced and babbling your throefester speak and flipping off the shit with your own crazy deathwish thing why do you think you know what was going through my head
TG: youre just assuming and throwing around psyche buzzwords like aspd complex disorder
%
TG: in your case probably
%
TG: its some delirious biznasty alright
%
TG: yes ima authorize a GOD DAMN you may swipe it at the door to check yourself into the burn ward
%
TG: nah those are kept in emergency reserve for yo mama jokes from the 90s
TG: anyway
TG: im telling you if i said anything at all about it she probably doesnt even fire her gun once and all im doing is dragging her into a doomed timeline with me
%
TG: none of this is that big a deal
TG: i just mentioned the basics to her
TG: that id stop time traveling soon
TG: break out of the loops
TG: not have to wonder all the time if i was taking a wrong turn and dooming everybody
TG: i was never that cool with this
%
TG: you know how you turned out to be this incredibly shitty seer of light and basically failed at that in every way imaginable
%
TG: well maybe i never wanted to be a knight of time
TG: maybe id rather just be like
TG: the dave of guy
TG: you know just some dude
%
TG: i guess not
TG: guess i failed my quest then
TG: so im like
TG: now what bitches
TG: to nobody in particular i guess
%
TG: yes those exact bitches
%
TG: oh yeah
TG: i remember that now
TG: then i guess thats what happened
TG: i delivered the bomb and now i must be dead
%
TG: is that wrong
%
TG: because i made the map so i know how to get there better
%
TG: ok if you remember it all so clearly why are you grilling me on this shit
TG: will you just tell me whats going on
%
TG: well i am
TG: because i should
TG: or should have
TG: man what the fuck is going on
TG: am i dead or are you dead or what
%
TG: uh
TG: oh yeah
TG: we were trying to figure out a way to detach the moon
TG: so i could pilot it out there
TG: fly it into the sun
%
TG: but the chain was huge
TG: couldnt think of how to break it
TG: then out of nowhere this sword appears in the thing
TG: so im thinking obviously i have to break the sword somehow
TG: because thats all i fucking do is break swords
%
TG: but as im thinking of how to do it i put my hand on it
TG: and it just snaps off with this comical shattering noise
TG: like i just fucked up some priceless shit in the louvre
%
TG: see like that
TG: like i did again just there with my hand
TG: cause of dreambubbles
TG: remember when that happened
%
TG: then i took it and sliced the chain
TG: like this
TG: damn
TG: it still cuts like its plowing through a shaft of boneless zombie meat
%
TG: whoops
TG: yeah
%
TG: so then
TG: the moon started drifting away
TG: and i was going to fly up
TG: and take it to the sun
TG: and i said something to you
TG: or i was going to
TG: like say bye or something
TG: but you were just standing there not saying anything
TG: holding that ball of yarn
%
TG: and then
TG: oh
TG: god thats right
%
TG: come on
TG: knocking me out so you can steal the suicide mission
TG: god dammit
TG: that is so trite
%
TG: its like
TG: heres how bad this is
TG: were are basically bruce willis and ben affleck from johns shitty crappy movie
TG: you made this even more armageddon than it already was
TG: sealing me in the air lock so i can go home to liv tyler and have the most terrible babies with her
%
TG: the bunny or the actress
%
TG: you not knocking me out with a ball of fucking yarn is fucking what
%
TG: this probably comes close but that doesnt make it not lame as hell
%
TG: its cool you are so tickled by this i hope it brought you a lot of rad laughs on your way to go fucking explode
%
TG: so thats it
TG: im actually lying here on derse asleep
TG: and you went out there and blew up the sun
TG: and now youre dead and im dream chilling with your smug ghost
%
TG: so youre not dead
%
TG: then youre dreaming
TG: what youre taking a little nap on the moon in the middle of nowhere
%
TG: ok
TG: so all those questions you asked me
TG: getting me to remember
TG: you were just stalling me werent you
TG: so i wouldnt wake up and try to stop you
%
TG: this sucks
TG: could you just please turn the thing around and come back
%
TG: we agreed id do it though
TG: or at least you pretended to agree
TG: just before going into a major league wind up with your nap yarn
%
TG: sports
%
TG: all im saying is
TG: no one likes a basketball hog
%
TG: i just think you should know
TG: that in the athletic arena of competitive achievement
TG: its a widely known fact that cherry picking posers get showered in nothin but boos
TG: you dont gank the rock and steal the big mans thunder on his raucus drive to the hole
%
TG: is that the sort of ignominy you want
TG: see you didnt consider sports you never consider the sports
%
TG: and yet
TG: such has been whats happened
TG: it like the tight end was going long down the yard in sudden death
TG: its me im the tight end
TG: and the quarterback sniped the fieldgoal just before the nfl buzzer went off
TG: the greedy qb is you
%
TG: but instead of winning the gold sports prize you just fucking die and nobody cares and it didnt mean anything
%
TG: the football prize
%
TG: no come on
TG: its called the bruce bombardi trophy or something
TG: for best pile squad
%
TG: and even though youre dead all these fat millionaires in helmets just leap on your corpse anyway and pile up and i mean WAY up
%
TG: the sport pile doesnt stop from getting taller
%
TG: what do you care youll be dead like the mission thieving poser you are
%
TG: yes poser it should be my torso getting pulverized by that avalanche of overpaid beefcakes and you know it
%
TG: there obviously stopped being a difference between those things the question is offensive
TG: almost as offensive as you stalling me while you peel out of here in your dumb moon
%
TG: yeah but i dont know how to wake back up is the thing
TG: how do i wake back up
%
TG: ok then do it
%
TG: but this was my mission
%
TG: that doesnt make sense
TG: why would they drag me into it just to have me make a map and then let you ditch me
TG: theyve obviously been gunning for me too
%
TG: why do you think that
%
TG: but i dont want you to die
%
TG: this isnt right
%
TG: so you admit you were stalling with all that bullshit
%
TG: what do you mean
%
TG: ............
%
TG: what
%
TG: sure
TG: but
TG: if im promising not to chase you down then theres not really any hurry to wake up
%
TG: nah ill stay asleep a while
